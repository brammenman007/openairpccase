# openairpccase
These are the drawings for an open air pc case i designed, please read this README.txt

Thanks for checking out my design!

some things to note:

- the measurements we're made with 18mm thick wood in mind, so if you we're to recreate this with a diffrent thickness material
please ajust everywhere where it says 18mm

- this was made for a full size ATX motherboard and a vertical gpu mount, but you could still mount a gpu horizontal if necessary 

- this design was just for fun and although i tried to make it acurate there may be variations based on hardware

- for storage the idea was to mount harddrives or ssd's on the backside also with the use of standoffs
